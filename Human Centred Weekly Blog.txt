Another week on campus
Some parts interesting
Ms


What have I learnt this week?
Introduction to the many model thinking approach
Also learnt a lot about the application of this
Found that commuting to campus 
What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Models can be applied to new fields outside of their intended use. Models can embed and leverage more data then humans can alone, and cant commit logical eros.
What insights have I gained?
Variety of models is more effective than any single. Sum of parts is stronger
Three approaches to models, embodiment, analogy and alternative.
Models have seven different uses, 
What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Arrogance to the effectiveness of models
However found it easy to understand the uses and implications of the models we have seen so far
What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Challenged preconceived ideas of effectiveness of models
What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Start to research some models and expand my thinking
What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Found the alternative reality approach especially useful. 
REDCAPE for reframing use of models




Wk 3
What have I learnt this week?
Number of models including race to the bottom, spatial choice models, signalling and LOTB value
What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Know there a variety of models i've never heard of
Similarly know I will not be planning on using any of the models I forgot walking out of the workshop for the sole reason that their importance or use was not immediately apparent.
What insights have I gained?
That these models can be applied to everyday life. 
Some Models are much better with weighted values e.g. Spatial Choice Models
What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Discovered I can apply a number of these models to my everyday life to improve or better handle a number of situations
What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Partly n/a as teams not formed. Found it challenging to stay focused during the entirety of the 3 hour workshop. This may be because I bore easily and was not engaged during the class, but was much more so reading the models in my own time
What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Though we were exposed to a large number of models this week I didn't particularly engage with any of them. The implication of this is that each student responds to models differently and I should take one of two approaches to maximised my success in the group tasks - Become familiar with every single model to maximise the probability I can be an asset to the team, or pick a flexible model and become an expert in it, as specialising will improve the quality of any responses or uses for said model.
What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Discovered that Signaling, costly, continuous extremely useful in general life. Found them extremely intresting
Because I engaged so meaningfully with it I see the applications in everyday life more easily
Wk 4 
What have I learnt this week?
System dynamics, Networks, Agent Based Modelling
What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
System Dynamics. Causal loop diagram.
Existence of models like the Lotka-Volterra model for modelling predator and prey populations
What insights have I gained?
I went into this course with a lot of arrogance to the effectiveness of models in new 
What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Discovered I am very quick to assume the depth or difficulty of learning models.  Was way out of my depth when I said I thought it was easy to understand the uses and implications of the models we have seen so far. So many models with niche applications
What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Group work was not worth mentioning. Relatively easy to do this week. I did however struggle with getting through reading the models in my own time. I hope this does not continue for the rest of the semester.
What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
.Focus more specifically on a number of models or loop diagrams 
What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Agent based modelling was great because It allowed me to break down parts of the group work very quickly. I went on to do further reading about Macal and North and there conclusion, learning that agents must adapt their behaviors and this is fundamental to organisations

What have I learnt this week?
Probability distributions, power laws, long tailed distributions, some linear models. Very interesting stuff about self -organised criticality
What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Written during the group work: “Groups suck if people aren't interested in being involved”
That there are easier ways to handle ineffective team members then getting stressed over them.
Logical consequences of self organised criticality
What insights have I gained?
Some interesting insights regarding how power law behaviour is seen in such a large variety of disciplines or life ares e.g. fungi, stocks, growth
What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
I have a low tolerance for non-constructive or lack of input. Also have a tendency to try and bully people into being useful if I judge they aren't
What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Had some issues with students being in the zoom call / breakout room and providing no useful input or staying muted. I was getting super frustrated because I hate the concept of carrying someone else's degree on my back. 
What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Rather than getting frustrated - needed to reframe the problem. That the group work would reflect more of my individual 
What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Signalling. The group members' choice to remain muted signalled an interest in passing with minimal effort. Interesting to try and read into background and motivations

What have I learnt this week?
Markov Chains, Path dependence
What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Hadn't realised the implications of the models mentioned above. Also now know that graphic design work difficulty varies greatly between tasks.
What insights have I gained?
Insights that my limited knowledge of photoshop is actually a great aid to group work.
Learnt that I will favour the interesting and new models rather than boring stuff I already know
What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Not sure whether to categorise it as a strength or a weakness, but I am quite proud of my work. Here is the group work from this week I am proud of
  

Also learnt that my individual flare can show through in my work and writing. 
What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Some challenges with communication as the team encountered some technical difficulties. Managed to work around this using zoom text chat and produce a diagram we were particularly proud off.
What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
.Probably would have created a draft for how to format the content before receiving it as a lot of time was wasted reformatting to suit the space.
What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Not to many theories directly applicable to today

What have I learnt this week?
Segregation and peer effects, replicator equation, fisher's theorem, emergence of culture / coordination
What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Now I know there are way more applications for replication or culture then I had assumed. 
Also found I can get super wrapped up into topics .e.g I spent a very long time reading about fisher's theorem (disproportionate amount)
What insights have I gained?
Discovered Interactive diagrams can be super engaging
That i can apply these models to real life and should find some that are suited towards problem solving or negotiation to help myself in future
What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
I discussed the min/max approach to this subject for group work in my week 3 reflection. I should note that based on my experiences I am much better at the specialising approach.
What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Had a number of challenges with staying on topic. Not to much worth noting as far as group work is concerned
What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
.Focus more on less interesting topics. I spent too much of my time focused on Fisher's theorem and the ultimatum game, and not enough on the others. Means I probably missed some very important models I could apply to my own life 
What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
        Nothing worth noting here
Wk 8
What have I learnt this week?
Colonel Blotto Game, prisoner's dilemma
What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
That the competition forces engagement.
That a number of these models can be applied to my social and work lives.
Colonel Blotto game super engaging
What insights have I gained?
Tend to rush into things without reading. 
What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Discovered i am a strategic mastermind
Also discovered i can be impatient
What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
I was overly excited with the concept of competition and developed an advanced method designed to beat the proven most popular method. Super happy with my approach until I read the discussion board and realised it was all about discussing how this was similar to covid-19 and not actually playing the dilemma. 
What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Need to read the question before diving into it.
I've also ordered the book thinking in systems which provides a series of models for problem solving
What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Both mentioned dilemmas proved useful and engaging. Have learnt a bit about human psychology

What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Unfortunately I didn't learn too much this week as I was busy with other uni and some personal issues. 
What insights have I gained?
From group formation I learned that I snap judge people. 
What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Unsure whether to consider these snap judgements a strength or not. Means i can profile people and predict their behaviors and plan around them. Also means i can be dead wrong and make a fool of myself or come across as rude. 
What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Challenges with managing workload and emotionally straining situations
What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I think the snap judgements can prove to be a useful tool for management and effective group work in the short term
What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Signally. I'm aware I mentioned this model many times but it spoke to me particularly well. The snap judgments i mention are based of continuous or costly signalling

What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Unfortunately, much like last week, I was not able to find much time to learn much this week. Did however review the causal loop diagrams briefly.
What insights have I gained?
Group discussions can be difficult when face-to-face is removed.Whilst convenient to use text it is largely ineffective to convey emotions, tone or immediacy
What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Very strong 
What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
I was unaware of the struggle to communicate over text. Typically I know what people look like and this helps me to gauge my tone and style. Didn't have this in this situation
What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
.Force video calls or voice chat. Used to using discord and phone calls so voice is more comfortable too. Could potentially incorporate more emojis
What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Causal loop diagram is going to be used in my group's assignment submission. I needed to reread it before I worked on it.

Wk 11
What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I didn't realise how varied causal loop diagrams could be, as a i spent more time reading up on them and their formation this week
What insights have I gained?
Some insights about time management and prioritisation. Particularly the use of time planners
What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
I can seriously miss-prioritise work or waste time. However I do have a super busy schedule so it's understandable if time pressures mount. 
What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
All group members (only the three of us) struggled to find time to work on the assessment this week due to other subjects, assignments and exams
What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
.Scheduling issues. MIght need to use a weekly planner rather than just a daily and general overview one
What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
        n/a

What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Group work can be super difficult and frustrating. Also found that Casual Loop diagrams are very complex even though initially they look simple. 
What insights have I gained?
Building time pressures and stress can have a negative effect on productivity and timeliness. Especially with unhealthy habits or schedule
What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Good habits built up across my last 18 months of uni and generally good sleep schedule. Unfortunately I do drain a large portion of my time at work, which is required but frustrating. 
What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Challenges revolving time management. Could have prepared for some exams earlier to give myself more time on the group assignment. Luckily for me my group was given an extension on the group work. Unfortunately this makes the process of reflecting somewhat negligible. 
What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
.I think I would keep a more specific log of my work in class as I had forgotten what work belongs to which week. Also should probably NA work for the last couple of weeks of the semester to allow myself more time
What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
n/a
